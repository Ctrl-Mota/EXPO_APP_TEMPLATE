# React Native Expo Template

A simple Expo template with the following features:

- Prettier configured
- React Navigation v5
- Boosted navigator animation for an increased visual performance
- Intermediary project structure
- Small component library to get started with
- LightTheme and DarkTheme pre-configureds
- UseContext with UseReducer to manage global contexts
- Responsive fontsize


It's easy to create a project, strip out the few components included, and still have the architecture in place to quickly start building an app.
